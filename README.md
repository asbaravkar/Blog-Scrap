# The problem
To stay updated in "Machine Learning/Data Science/ Artificial Intelligence" I read few blogs every day. 
But finding a good article is really tough. I've to go through many websites in order to get a good article.
I'm really lazy. I don't want to go through every website one by one.

# Solution
So I've listed out all the blogs (Website) that I read the most, 
and then I scrape them and made my own personal website. 
In which I don't have to go through every website to read the blog.
I can find them all on my website.
